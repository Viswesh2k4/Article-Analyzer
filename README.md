# Article-Analyzer
Article Analyzer is an AI-powered news research application built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq LLMs to help users extract meaningful insights from online articles. By processing multiple article URLs, the app scrapes and cleans content using Requests, then splits it into semantic chunks with the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. It generates vector embeddings through Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and stores them in a FAISS vector database, enabling fast similarity-based retrieval. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, the system fetches the most relevant article segments and produces context-grounded responses via Groq’s llama-3.1-8b-instant model. Built for researchers, analysts, and students, Article Analyzer provides transparent source references, efficient document search, and intelligent question-answering with a clean and interactive Streamlit UI.
